                    3. HOW WE COLLECT DATA

                    We collect Data in the following ways:
                    Information You Give Us: We receive and store any information you enter on our Platforms or give us
                    in any other way (e.g., at outlets, stores, hotels, kiosks). Please see the section titled “Data
                    Shared by You” for more information.
                    Automatic Information We Collect: We use “cookies”, pixels and similar technologies to receive and
                    store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. Please see the section below,
                    titled “Data that is Collected Automatically” for more information.
                    E-mail Communications: To help us make e-mails more relevant and interesting, we often receive a
                    confirmation (if your device supports such capabilities) when you open e-mail from us or click on a
                    link in the e-mail. You can choose not to receive marketing emails from us by clicking on the
                    unsubscribe link in any marketing email.
                    Automatic Information We Collect from Other Websites: We receive and store certain types of
                    information when you interact with third-party websites that use our technology or with whom we have
                    a specific agreement. Because we process this information on behalf of the applicable website
                    operators, collection, processing, and use of such information is subject to the applicable website
                    operators’ specific privacy policies and is not covered by our Privacy Notice.
                    Information from Other Sources: We may obtain information from other sources. An example of this is
                    when you authorize a third-party website (such as the website of another Handcraft Group Entity), to
                    interact directly with our Platforms to provide or receive Data about you. In that case, we might
                    receive such Data used by that third-party website to identify your account with that website.

                    You can make choices about our collection and use of your Data. For example, you may want to access,
                    edit or remove your Data on our Platforms. When you are asked to provide Data, you may decline.

                    4.DATA SHARED BY YOU

                    If you provide Data on behalf of any corporation, company, institution, association or other entity,
                    you represent that you are providing the same under authority from such corporation, company,
                    institution, association or other entity.

                    We automatically collect some information when you visit our Platforms. This information helps us to

                    provide you with offers (including for financial products and/or services), personalized services

                    operate, evaluate and improve our business and our Platforms;

                    communicate with you (including to respond to your requests, questions, feedback, claims or

                    may be), where required under applicable law. Some of the above grounds for processing will overlap
                    and there may be several grounds which justify our use of your personal information.

                    as necessary to provide you with products and/or services; to comply with a legal obligation; or

                    resolving disputes, enforcing our agreements and as long as processing and retaining your Data is
                    necessary for our legitimate interests. Because these needs can vary for different data types and
                    purposes, actual retention periods can vary significantly.

                    Even if we delete your Data, including on account of exercise of your right under Clause 11 below,
                    it may persist on backup or archival media for audit, legal, tax or regulatory purposes.

                    11.YOUR RIGHTS AND CHOICES

                    When we process Data about you, we do so with your consent and/or as necessary to operate our

                    may not have the same Data Protection Laws as the country in which you initially provided the

                    this Privacy Notice, as disclosed to you at the time of data collection or as described in our
                    program-specific privacy notice.
                    For processing your Data under this Policy we may transfer your Data to Partners outside India. Such
                    transfer shall be in accordance with Data Protection Laws of India.

                    Depending on which Data Protection Laws are applicable to you, you may have the right or choice to:
                    opt out of some collection or uses of your Data, including the use of cookies, pixels and similar
                    technologies and the use of your Data for marketing purposes.
                    access your Data, rectify it, restrict or object to its processing, or request its deletion or

                    TUL implements standard measures to protect against unauthorized access to and unlawful interception
                    of Data. However, no internet site can fully eliminate security risks. TUL endeavors to take all

                    for any loss, damage or misuse of the Data, if such loss, damage or misuse is attributable to a
                    Force Majeure Event. A "Force Majeure Event" means any event that is beyond the reasonable control
                    of TUL and includes, without limitation, fire, flood, explosion, acts of God, civil commotion,

                    If any court or competent authority finds that any provision of this Policy (or part of any
                    provision) is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that provision or part-provision will, to the
                    extent required, be deemed to be deleted, and the validity and enforceability of the other
                    provisions of this Policy will not be affected.
