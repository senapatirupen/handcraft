                    Return Shipping Process



                    Self-send Process



                    In case of return of products initiated and subsequent courier of the product by You, if it is found that the returned product was not delivered to the seller or any other designated location specified or the package was empty, the onus shall be on You to prove through submission of proof of delivery from the concerned courier service provider to establish Your claim of return. Self-courier of returns should be initiated within the periods specified in the Handcraft’s Returns Policy. Handcraft is not liable to process the return request until satisfactory proof of delivery is provided to Handcraft.



                    In case of damage claims, Handcraft may ask for pictures of the damaged product before it is approved or allowed for return.



                    For return shipping managed by Handcraft, You will need to hand over the product to the assigned logistics service provider at the time of pick-up. In the event the logistics service provider makes attempts to pick-up the product and You are unavailable or not ready to handover the product, Handcraft or logistics service provider will not be held responsible for the delay in pick-up or processing of the quality check by the seller and hence the refund. A maximum of 2 attempts will be made by the logistics service provider to pick-up the product to be returned. Handcraft will not be liable for the products returned by mistake.

                    In case where a seller or designated return location claims that the product received from You is different or the return of the product is not in compliance with the Returns Policy, the product will be dispatched back to Your shipping address and You are required to receive and accept the package. In the event of dispute, Handcraft will coordinate with You and the seller to reach an amicable solution. Handcraft is only a facilitating link between You and the seller and will not be liable in any manner.
